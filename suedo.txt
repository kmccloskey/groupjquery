JavaScript DOM Manipulation Exercises

Write a program to validate a date input. Given a date (06/15/1990, for instance), make sure that it's in mm/dd/yyyy format when the form gets submitted.

Continuing with this input validation, add a username and password ﬁeld. Make sure the user's password is "12345" and the username ﬁeld is not blank when the form gets submitted.
